## Element-Query Syntax
### `:Path`
* The wildcard character, `*`, is supported.
* If a wildcard character is used (i.e., `*`), search is case-insentive.
* Otherwise, search is case-sensitive and an exact match is a MUST.
### `:Type`
* The wildcard character, `*`, is supported.
* If no wildcard character is used, an exact match is a MUST.
* Search is always case-insensitive.
